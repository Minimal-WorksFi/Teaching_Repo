## Overview
So, this is a more open book assignment. This will be quite a bit harder for you, so I expect mooooooore or less daily updates. This is where github would've been... useful; but I guess I'll die mad. Anyways, keep it simple! You are going to make a text based video game, think of it in a similar manner to the calculator app. You will be using functions and no OOP (yet).

The game will be a 2D game, you can have a charachter that moves or not. Let's have for the sake of argument multiple enemy types. Ideally, you will keep a track of some kind of resources that the player uses; and you keep a track of some sort of score. You will be using everything, functions, lists, variables, alllllllllll the jazz. The question is open-ended so you can explore your own solutions and ideas.

The task may be open ended, but I have some specific requirements to help you come up with an idea. I recommend before even coding to spend some time working on a mental idea. Drawing sketches fo the algorithms and/or making a design document.

### Why am I doing this?
Why a video game, why not a web app or some random finance app or some boring shit. *Snooze*
First off, it will help you keep your attention on the goal. Video games are more fun to make. Second off, making a game will require WAAAAAAAAAAY more effort than finance app nr 15203415. It helps you build and refine some algorithmic skills aswell, and trains your creativity.

## Requirements

These are the requirements for the project.

### Primary Requirements
Obligatory requirements for the project:
 - A 2-D Matrix level, in which the player charachter is placed in.
 - The game works on a turn based system, so it's easy to play and easy to code.
 - Statistics, be it score, movements, whatnot.
 - At least 2 different kinds of obstacles/enemies.

### Bonus Requirements
Extra requirements:
 - Username would be nice. You could make a leaderboard out of it.
 - Multiple levels could be fun.
 - Easy to naviage UI
 - Actual gameplay

Once you acknowledge the readme, you will have two weeks to deliver this. Send me a message when you have.
