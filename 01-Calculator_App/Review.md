## Overall thoughts

Banger. Good job, you got most of it down. There are some parts here that caught me off guard but you did a splendid job overall.

## Requirements

### Criteria

**1.** Check. Good job.
**2.** Check. Minus points for not checking for division with 0, cause that breaks the app. Sad :c.
**3.** Check. You actually figured it out on your own, so that's a big plus already! You're one step closer to learning. Your... history algorithm leaves a bit to be desired, but you're already aware of that. Really really good job!
**4.** Sadly, this one might've been a bit much. I didn't expect it of you.

### General thoughts and critique.

Your solution for the 3rd requirement was really good! Using the lists the way you did was pretty smart. Later during the OOP course you will have all of that in just one list and it'll work out really well  :3. If I were to recommend something is to try and make the display of the information a bit better next time, a bit more well formatted. Solid job otherwise.

I was genuienly impressed by the fact you had a main function. The calc function. That is really really good. I want to point out though, be aware of how you place your functions. All the history update functions can ***ONLY*** be called by the calculator function, because they were initiated inside of it. The scope in which you create your functions is *really* important so please keep that in mind. You already have a few little sparks of functional programming in there, so it's a good sign.

## What's next?

Next up, you will have more exercises, and less "projects". I will have to think of some stuff to do, but I'm sure we can figure something out right?
