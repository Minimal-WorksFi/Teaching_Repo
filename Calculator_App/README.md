# Command Prompt Calculator

## Description

So, I want you to make a python calculator app. Let's say it has... Addition, substraction, multiplication and division.

## Requirements
Requirements for the calculator:

**1.** I want the calculator to have a nice (command) menu. A separate command line for each operation. And I want to select the options by tapping in the corresponding numher and pressing enter.


**2.**I want the calculator to take 2 inputs only for each operation, if you figure out how to do more that's a plus. Make sure the math doesnt break :3.


**3.** Make it so you save during runtime... The last 10 calculations. Save the input, output, and uh, method (+ - / *)


**4.**(Extra) Separate the code in multiple files.
