# Overview
Today (or when you feel like it.) You are going to learn how to use github and git. A very big step that will make you way better than your peers once you go to uni. It will also make organizing both my and your code wayyyyyyyy easier. Let's get started!

## What is git?
Basically, git is a version control system. What does that mean? It saves all the versions of your project by remembering the changes you do after each version, so it saves memory space. Git is incredibly useful for your workflow, because it allows you to save step by step, revert in case you fuck up, and collaborate with other people. That's great, now, I'm going to drop you a file and some links, pay attention to them following the specific timestamps.

## Exercise
Right, nerd talk over. What's the task? First off, please create a repository where you will store all of your homeworks and coding assignments that you do. Create a git repository there using the following command:

`git init`

Keep the console open, then, for the sake of making your life easy, run the:

`git config --global user.email (your github user)`
`git config --global user.name (your github user)`

This will keep your git credentials across all repositories you are going to work on. Very very useful, since you will probably make many more repositories. After that, follow the git basic commands tutorial and try to understand everything that you're doing. Please send a message with questions if you face any bumps.

After you finish, make sure to connect to the repository with your homeworks on github, and to push the calculator.py in a calculator folder. That way you can keep track of what you've learnt and done.

## What's next?

This is it for the basics of github and git, good job! :3. We will probably talk about branching more another time... I'm not sure how useful that would be since you're working solo, so we'll just leave it be.

**Please edit this link and put your repository in it.**
